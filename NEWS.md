# decor (development version)

* `cpp_files()` now always returns filepaths sorted according to the C locale.
  This prevents nuisance changes in files automatically generated by downstream tools, such as `cpp11::cpp_register()`, due to differences in the ambient locale (#13, @jennybc).

* `parse_cpp_function()` supports spaces before the argument list (#4).

# decor 1.0.1

* Romain Fran√ßois is now the maintainer.

* `cpp_decoration(is_attribute = TRUE)` now automatically ignores all decoration inside comments (#3)

# decor 1.0.0

* Initial release
