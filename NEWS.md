# decor 1.0.2

* Davis Vaughan is now the maintainer. 

* `cpp_files()` now always returns file paths sorted according to the C locale.
  This prevents nuisance changes in files automatically generated by downstream tools, 
  such as `cpp11::cpp_register()`, due to differences in the ambient locale (#13, @jennybc).

* `parse_cpp_function()` strips `//` comments (#8), supports spaces before 
   the argument list (#4) and handles ref/deref (#6, @nbenn).

# decor 1.0.1

* Romain François is now the maintainer.

* `cpp_decoration(is_attribute = TRUE)` now automatically ignores all decoration inside comments (#3)

# decor 1.0.0

* Initial release
